This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install the dependecies

First, you will need to Install the dependecies

To Install them, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install


## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```Android studion
# using npx
open the app on Android studio
Run the emulator
npx react-native start --reset-cache
Use a to run the app on android 



If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_  shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
